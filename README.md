## Aiming point
The repository wants to show how simple is to implement and use the toolkits powered by LangChain.
The examples in the repository are related to the SQLDatabase and JSON toolkits.

1. The line `from env import load_env` refers to a method created ad hoc to create the environment variables needed to call AzureOpenAI library 
2. To execute `db_toolkit.py`, a running database is needed. The one used during the demo can be found [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)
